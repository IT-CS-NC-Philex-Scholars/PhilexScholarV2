# Scholarship Management System Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation

1. **Database Schema**:
   - Created all necessary migrations for the tables
   - Added proper foreign key constraints and relationships
   - Implemented enum types for all status fields
   - Created computed columns for automatic slot calculation

2. **Models**:
   - Updated the User model with role field and relationship to StudentProfile
   - Created StudentProfile model with school type and level fields
   - Created ScholarshipProgram model with budget calculations
   - Created DocumentRequirement model to define required documents
   - Created ScholarshipApplication model with comprehensive status workflow
   - Created DocumentUpload model with various rejection statuses
   - Created CommunityServiceReport model
   - Created Disbursement model for payment tracking

3. **Seeders**:
   - Created an admin user account
   - Added sample scholarship programs for both high school and college
   - Added document requirements for each scholarship program

## Database Structure

- **Users**: Basic authentication with admin/student roles
- **StudentProfiles**: Student information including address and school details
- **ScholarshipPrograms**: Scholarship details with budget, eligibility criteria, and deadlines
- **ScholarshipApplications**: Tracks the entire application process with comprehensive status workflow
- **DocumentRequirements**: Defines what documents are needed for each scholarship
- **DocumentUploads**: Tracks uploaded documents and their approval status
- **CommunityServiceReports**: Tracks community service completion
- **Disbursements**: Tracks payment processing and status

## Application Workflow

1. Student signs up and creates profile with school information
2. Student applies for scholarship programs matching their school type
3. Student uploads required documents
4. Admin reviews documents and checks for eligibility
5. Eligible students are enrolled in the program
6. Students complete community service requirements
7. Admin processes disbursements after service completion

## Next Steps

1. **Create Controllers**:
   - AuthController for authentication
   - StudentProfileController for profile management
   - ScholarshipProgramController for listing available programs
   - ScholarshipApplicationController for application management
   - DocumentUploadController for document management
   - CommunityServiceReportController for service reporting
   - DisbursementController for payment tracking

2. **Create Views**:
   - Authentication views
   - Student profile form
   - Scholarship listing and details
   - Application form
   - Document upload interface
   - Community service report form
   - Admin dashboard for application review
   - Disbursement tracking interface

3. **Implement Business Logic**:
   - Automatic slot calculation and availability checking
   - Eligibility verification (GPA, units)
   - Document validation
   - Application workflow state management
   - Notification system for status updates
   - Payment processing integration

4. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for models and business logic
   - Feature tests for controllers
   - Integration tests for the complete workflow
